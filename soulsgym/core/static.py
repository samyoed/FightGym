"""The ``soulsgym.core.static`` module is a collection of all module constants.

We read all config files into dictionaries and make them available as Python objects. The static
collection is useful beyond the ``core`` module itself. We provide a complete list of possible
values for boss and player animations. These can be employed to fit one-hot encoders to animation
names prior to learning.
