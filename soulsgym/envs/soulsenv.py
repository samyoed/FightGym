"""The ``soulsenv`` module provides the abstract base class for all ``soulsgym`` environments.

This :class:`~.SoulsEnv` class includes the general gym logic and defines abstract methods that all
environments have to implement.

In addition, we also provide a :class:`~.SoulsEnvDemo` base class for demo environments. In contrast
to the training environments, demos cover all phases of a boss fight and allow to demonstrate the
agent's abilities in a setting that is as close to the real game as possible.

    Each ``SoulsEnv`` initializes a :class:`.GameInput`, a :class:`.GameWindow`, a :class:`.Game`
    interface and a :class:`.Logger` to read from and to the game. During an episode the game is
    paused per default. At each :meth:`.SoulsEnv.step` call the environment applies the current
    input if valid (see :meth:`.SoulsEnv._apply_action` for details). It then unpauses the game,
    waits for ``step_size`` seconds and pauses again. During that time, the game runs with a speed
    multiplier defined by ``game_speed``. The new game state is logged and processed to update the
    internal game state. The environment tries to detect and recover from any unexpected errors.

    To solve any camera control issues we lock on to the boss at all times. For exceptions see
    :meth:`.SoulsEnv._lock_on`.

    Note:
        We deem it too complicated to learn from the image alone. The :class:`.GameWindow` class is
        however designed to provide this capability and the gym can easily be extended to yield
        image data as well.

    Warning:
        The target game has to be running at the initialization of :class:`SoulsEnv`.

    Warning:
        Setting ``game_speed`` too high might result in unstable behaviour. The maximal value is
        determined by hardware factors. We strongly recommend to stick to values in the range of
        [1, 3].
