"""The ``Game`` classes provide a Python interface for the game properties of the Souls games.

They abstract the memory manipulation into properties and functions that write into the appropriate
game memory addresses.

Note:
    The interface is essentially a wrapper around the :class:`.MemoryManipulator`. As such it
    inherits the same cache restrictions. See :data:`.MemoryManipulator.cache`,
    :meth:`.Game.clear_cache` and :meth:`.MemoryManipulator.clear_cache` for more information.

Warning:
    Writing into the process memory is not guaranteed to be "stable". Race conditions with the main
    game loop *will* occur and overwrite values. Coordinates are most affected by this.
